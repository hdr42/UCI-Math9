Lecture 1
---------

Pep-talk: Programming is great because it allows you to compute any function, or run any procedure very quickly on the computer. If you like math, you will like programming. My hope in this course is to teach you how to write programs quickly, and think of computational thinking as something inseparable from mathematics. 

It is not an easy skill to learn, but if you don't despair (and notice when you do and do something about it) you will take great joy from it.

We will use Python. We will also use Matlab towards the end. (you can get a free student license for matlab, don't pay for it)
